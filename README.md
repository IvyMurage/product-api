# Simple Product Application - NodeJS Practice

This is a product management application built to explore Node.js and MongoDB while focusing on proper project structure and separation of concerns. The API was developed using:
- **Express Framework**
- **MongoDB** for data storage
- **Mongoose** for schema definition and management

### Objective:
The primary goal was to learn how to effectively organize files in a Node.js project. For instance:
- **Database connection** is managed in a separate file.
- **Product routes**, **models**, and **controllers** each have their own dedicated files.

### Features:
- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for product management.
- Clean separation of concerns to keep the code modular and maintainable.
